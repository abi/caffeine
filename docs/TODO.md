* Pick a name for the language that's forked from Coffee. I'd like the various strains of the language that people
  will create with their own compiler as "blends". Everyone can have their own favorite blend of Coffee (or rather __
  insert our language name__)
* Add more stuff to common JS bugs
* Add more papers to list of papers
* Email John about units + the aforementioned two pages
